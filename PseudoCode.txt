FindLowestEntropy()
	Return the cell that has the lowest greater-than-zero enropy

Propagate()
	Loop until no more cells are left to be updated
		for each neihboring cell:
			for each pattern that is still potentially valid
				compare this location in the pattern with the cell's values
					if this point in the pattern no longer matches
						set the array in the wave to false for this pattern
						flag this cell as needing to be updated in the next iteration

OutputObservations() //Gives visual feedback of what is happening, might be very expensive
	for each cell
		show the possible patterns for the cell
	return the full agregation
